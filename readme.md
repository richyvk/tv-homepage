Just a small html project to make a homepage for the Mac Mini I use as my home media PC.

Wanted to test some basic Bootstrap skills after completing the Bootstrap section of FreeCodeCamp, http://www.freecodecamp.com/

Search bar section may not display correctly in Firefox or IE due to css I applied. I use Chrome so didn't bother investigating cross-browser support.
